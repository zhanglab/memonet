# This file details what each script is used for
DESC_highRankGenes_step1_loop.py and DESC_highRankGenes_step1_loop15.py: loop through combos of DESC parameters using 7 and 15 decimal files, respectively, to see which parameter combo gives best consensus bt 7 and 15 decimal input files
DESC_DGclustering.py: clustering using DG-subset genelist
DESeq2_tr_vs_ctrl.r: DE analysis of all glut,GABA, or L2/3 cells
DESeq2_whole_subclusters.r: DE analysis of one cluster vs others. Does this in a loop.
DESeq2_clusterX_vs_clusterY_whole_loop.r: DE analysis of one cluster vs a specified ref cluster. It goes through all in a loop.
DESeq2-table.r: combine DE results into one file
labelTransfer_AO_umapDESC.r: map AIBS L2/3 cells onto our clusters; on unity, it errors at the MapQuery step and doesn't produce the umap images, but all we need is the prediction_scores.csv file for now
